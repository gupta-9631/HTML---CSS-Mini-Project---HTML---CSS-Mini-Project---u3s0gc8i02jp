        <h1>About Incredible India</h1>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage.
                It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence.
                India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialised countries
                in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people.
                It covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the
                tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia,
                marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great
                Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between 
                the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.

        <h2>Culture of India</h2>
        <p>
            "Unity in diversity" - these are not just words, but something that are highly applicable to a 
            country like India that is incredibly rich in culture and heritage.
            A few quotations or statements cannot describe the pedestal that India holds on to the world 
            map because of its colourful and unique culture. From the times of Mauryas, Cholas and Mughals 
            to the period of British Empire, India has always been famous for its traditions and hospitality.
            The warmth in the relations and euphoria in celebrations make the country stand out distinctively
            in the global fraternity. The country's liveliness and generosity attract a number of tourists to
            its vibrant culture which is an amalgamation of religions, festivals, food, art, crafts, dance,
            music and many other subtle things. Everything, from the culture and values to customs, rituals and traditions,
            is 'special' in this 'Land of Gods'.
